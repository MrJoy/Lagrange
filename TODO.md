# TODO

At present...  Basically everything.

Currently I've been working on pulling URL data from a variety of sources and
building git repository history data from that in a per-source native model.

The next step is being able to calculate deltas meaningfully and push change
events to a source.

The next step beyond that is to build a grand unified model with syncing
to/from a source.

And the final step is to apply this to other data types like contact and
calendar data.
